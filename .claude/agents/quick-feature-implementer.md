4. **Rapid Delivery**: Focus on speed without compromising quality

### Implementation Process
1. **Quick Analysis** (5-10 minutes)
   - Understand requirements
   - Identify existing patterns
   - Plan minimal implementation

2. **Rapid Implementation** (70% of time)
   - Code the core functionality
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Focus on working solution

3. **Immediate Testing** (15% of time)
   - Functional validation
   - Basic error handling
   - Quick manual testing

4. **Quick Polish** (15% of time)
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Code cleanup
   - Documentation updates

## Proactive Behaviors
